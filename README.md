# WeCare
An IoT functional android application to  help in day-to-day medication and health routine.

The project contains 4 modules (hardware [arduino, node-mcu], analytics, backend, application).
However some components need still to be completed. Here's the status of each module.

* Hardware ✔️
* Analytics ✔️
* Backend ✖️ (analytics still isn't integrated problem with DJL so for temprorary workaround ``HealthService`` delgates work to external flask server which hosts the DL model).
* Application ✖️ (``HealthService`` left to be integrated along with minor fixes)
